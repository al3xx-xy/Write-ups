## What is CSRF tokens

A CSRF token is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value that is generated by the server-side application and shared with the client. When attempting to perform a sensitive action, such as submitting a form, the client must include the correct CSRF token in the request. This makes it very difficult for an attacker to construct a valid request on behalf of the victim.

A common way to share CSRF tokens with the client is to include them as a hidden parameter in an HTML form, for example:

```
<form name="change-email-form" action="/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
	<label>Email</label>
	<input required type="email" name="email" value="example@normal-website.com">
	<input required type="hidden" name="csrf" value="50FaWgdOhi9M9wyna8">
	<button class='button' type='submit'> Update email </button>
</form>

```
